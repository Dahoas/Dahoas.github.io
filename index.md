## About
Hi I'm Alex Havrilla. I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech studying Machine Learning. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a MS/BS in mathematics and an additional major in computer science. This is a repository for my work.

## Research Interests

Broadly speaking I am interested in applications of Reinforcement Learning to Natural Language Processing working toward the construction of a General AI. Pursuant of this I have jointed <a href="https://github.com/Dahoas/DeepGalerkinMethod">Eleuther AI</a>.

I believe interpretability of our networks is crucial for systemic progres toward this general goal so my main research focuses in Neural Network Learning Theory; Specifically how the structure of a given problem/data informs the necessary structure of approximating network with some arbitrary accuracy.
