<p>Hi, I'm Alex Havrilla! I'm a research scientist at Google DeepMind studying the theoretical/practical limits of AI creativity and discovery. This work often spans a broad set of fields including Network Statistical and Approximation theory, RL, LLMs, Synthetic Data, and open-endedness.</p>
        
        
<p>I recently obtained my PhD in Machine Learning from Georgia Tech with a disseretation titled "Toward a Theory and Practice of Open-ended Reasoning with Generative Models". I was advised by (the amazing) <a href="https://wliao60.math.gatech.edu/">Wenjing Liao</a>. Also during this time I was fortunate to intern with FAIR, Microsoft Research, and Google Research. Additionally, I co-founded CarperAI: an early open-source research group studying RLHF at scale.</p>

<p>Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a joint MS/BS in mathematics and an additional major in computer science. My <a href="artifacts/thesis_draft_3.pdf">master's thesis</a> surveyed and proved novel Khintchine type inequalities for random variables.</p>

# Research

My research covers a broad range of topics intersecting with generative modeling including LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, Diffusion Models, and statistical/approxmation theory for generative models. Recently, I've been deeply engaged in exploring ways to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge discovery, utilizing techniques from reinforcement learning. On the theoretical front, I focus on approximation and statistical theories for generative models, with a strong emphasis on validating these theories through empirical observations.
